# Chip-Computation
The Chip Project is an exploration of specialized computing chips designed to perform elementary arithmetic operations. Each chip in the system is responsible for one operation—such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or negation—and they are connected in sequence to carry out complex computations step by step.

Project Goals
The primary objective of this project is to build a functional chain of chips that can process numerical input and generate accurate results by performing arithmetic operations in a predefined order. The computations are passed from one chip to the next, ultimately leading to an output chip that displays the final result.

Key Features
Modular Design: Each chip is modular and can be adjusted to handle different arithmetic operations.
Sequential Processing: The chips are connected in a sequence to ensure the orderly flow of data and operations.
Dynamic Computation: Input data is dynamically processed through the chip network, with each stage updating the computation before passing it on.
Final Output Chip: The last chip in the sequence collects the computed data from the previous stages and displays the final result.
Technical Details
Operations Supported: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and negation.
Chip Connections: Chips are interconnected in a chain, each contributing to the calculation.
Error Handling: The project includes error checks for incorrect input and chip malfunctions.
Optimization: Ongoing efforts to optimize chip communication and reduce computation time
